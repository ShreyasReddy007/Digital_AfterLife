# Digital Afterlife Vault

Protecting Your Digital Legacy

In today's digital world, everything we hold most dear; our treasured memories, our documents, our messages, live online. But what happens to them when we are no longer? Our platform is a digital dead man's switch, a digital vault that can custodian your final message, your last call to action, and your final files. 

Think of this as a bridge from the past of your today to the future of your tomorrow; a trusted steward for your legacy.
Whether it’s messages of love to family and friends, or critical information to help account for the family, nothing is lost, everything is encrypted and nothing is released until the time you want.

This isn’t only about storing data — it’s about the storage of meaning, the storage of continuity, the storage of moving on. Your digital voice, thoughts and intentions survive — a secure line of communication that reaches the intended people, when they need it the most.

# 📜 About The Project
Digital Afterlife Vault is a secure legacy-planning web application that safeguards and automatically delivers your sensitive digital information to designated recipients. Acting as a trusted digital executor, it ensures that your important messages, documents, and memories are passed on exactly according to your wishes, triggered by specific times or life events.

# 🌟 Key Features
## 🔐 Secure Vault Creation:  
Create encrypted "vaults" containing text messages or files. All content is secured and only accessible when trigger conditions are met.

## 🕰️ Delivery Triggers: 
Each vault has automated delivery conditions:

#### 1) Date-Based Trigger: 
Automatically delivers the vault's contents on a specific future date.

#### 2) Inactivity Trigger: 
Triggers delivery if your account remains inactive for a set period (e.g., six months), ensuring your legacy is passed on even in unforeseen circumstances.

#### 3) 🔑 Emergency Recovery Key: 
Generate a one-time, offline recovery key. A trusted individual can use this key to trigger the immediate delivery of all your vaults, bypassing other triggers in case of an emergency.

## 🕊️ Secure Recipient Access: 
Designated recipients are notified via email when a vault is triggered. They can access the contents securely through a password-less login, ensuring a seamless and safe experience.
